way. When turning left, do not assume that an oncoming vehicle with its right turn signal on is turning before it reaches you. The driver may have their signal on by mistake or plan to turn just beyond you. Wait for the vehicle to start its turn before beginning the left turn. Passing You must judge whether you have enough space to pass whenever you approach: An oncoming vehicle or bicyclist. A hill, curve, intersection, or road obstruction. To safely pass, the hill or curve should be at least one-third of a mile ahead. Before you pass, look ahead for road conditions that may cause other vehicles to move into your lane. Do not pass: If you are approaching a hill or curve and cannot see if other traffic is approaching. This is very dangerous on one and two lane roads. Within 100 feet of an intersection, bridge, tunnel, railroad crossing, or other hazardous area. At crossroads and driveways. Unless you have enough space to return to your lane.27 How to Pass When you are going to pass on an open highway: Signal that you plan on passing. Look over your shoulder to check your blind spots. Drive into the passing lane. Speed up to pass the vehicle. Signal and return to your original lane. You may pass on the right only when: An open highway has two or more lanes going in your direction. The driver ahead of you is turning left and you can safely pass on the right. Never pass on the left if the driver is signaling a left turn. You are on a one-way street. Never drive off the paved or main-traveled part of the road to pass. Being Passed If a vehicle is passing you or signals that they plan on passing, allow the vehicle to pass. Maintain your lane position and your speed.28 Parking Parallel Parking Parallel parking is when you park in line with the road and other parked vehicles.
