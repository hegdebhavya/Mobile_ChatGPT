ace between your vehicle and the bicyclist. Right Wrong : When you cannot change lanes to pass a bicyclist, allow at least three feet between your vehicle and the bicyclist. If you cannot give three feet of space, do not pass the cyclist until three feet of clearance can be given. This will help you avoid putting the bicyclist in danger. Remember to Give bicyclists enough space so they are not forced into parked vehicles or open vehicle doors. Only merge toward the curb or into the bike lane when it is safe. Merge safely behind a bicyclist when preparing to make a turn. Enter a bike lane no more than 200 feet before starting a turn. Check for bicyclists when changing lanes or entering traffic. They may be hidden in a vehicleâ€™s blind spots. Be careful when approaching or passing a bicyclist on a two-lane road.51 Road Workers and Work Zones You will see warning signs and message boards when there are workers, slow-moving equipment, and closed lanes ahead. Go through the work zone carefully by: Slowing down. Allowing extra space between vehicles. Expecting sudden slowing or stopping. Watching for drivers changing lanes. Avoiding distractions. Cones, drums, or other barriers will guide you through the work zone. Prepare to slow down or stop for highway equipment. Merge as soon as it is safe without crossing the cones or drums. Watch for bicycles if lanes are narrow or the shoulder is closed. Obey special signs or instructions from workers such as flaggers. Fines and Double Fine Zones Fines for traffic violations in a work zone can be $1,000 or more. Anyone convicted of assaulting a highway worker faces fines of up to $2,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. Certain roads are chosen as Safety Enhanced-Double Fine Zones. This is due to increased collision-related injuries
