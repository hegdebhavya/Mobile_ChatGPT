n intersection is any place where one road meets another road. Controlled intersections have signs or traffic signal lights. Uncontrolled and blind intersections do not. Before entering an intersection, check for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Be prepared to slow down and stop if necessary. Pedestrians always have the right-of-way.

Give the right-of-way to any pedestrian or approaching vehicle that is close enough to be dangerous. Turning right: Always check for pedestrians crossing the street, and motorcycles and bicycles riding next to you. Green traffic signal light: Proceed with caution. Pedestrians have the right-of-way.
