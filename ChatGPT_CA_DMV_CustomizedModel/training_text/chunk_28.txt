If there is a limit line before the crosswalk, stop at the limit line and allow pedestrians to cross the street. Some crosswalks have flashing lights.

When a blind person pulls in their cane and steps away from the intersection, this gesture usually means you may go.

In these areas, your vehicle can disappear from a large vehicle or truck driver’s view. If you cannot see the truck’s side mirr
